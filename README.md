## Service for bank accounts.

Service provides next abilities:
* Create of a bank account 
* Get info about bank account

There is eureka client implementation. 

There is kafka implementation. Apache Kafka makes the data highly fault-tolerant. It protects against server failure by distributing storage of data streams in a fault-tolerant cluster.

There is consumer kafka implementation. When a doctor tries to register in [appointment-microservice(producer)](https://github.com/kermakovich/hospital-appointment), we need to create a bank account.
